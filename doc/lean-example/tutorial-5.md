# Lean App Tutorial, Part 5

This page assumes you've read Parts [1](tutorial-1.md), [2](tutorial-2.md),
[3](tutorial-3.md), and [4](tutorial-4.md).

The end of [Part 4](tutorial-4.md) pointed out that while the bodies of Lean
definitions, theorems, and examples can be split out from the name and type
of the definition, etc., they remain indivisible, which presents a challenge
to inserting helpful exposition among them.
