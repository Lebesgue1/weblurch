# webLurch

This repository is a rewrite of
[the math software Lurch](lurchmath.org) for the web.

For more information,
[see the source code](nathancarter.github.io/weblurch),
which is written in
[Markdown](daringfireball.net/projects/markdown) and
[literate coffeescript](coffeescript.org/#literate), and is thus
self-documenting.
