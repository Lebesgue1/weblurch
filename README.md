# webLurch

This repository is a rewrite of
[the math software Lurch](http://lurchmath.org) for the web.

For more information,
[see the source code](http://nathancarter.github.io/weblurch),
which is written in
[Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown) and
[literate coffeescript](http://coffeescript.org/#literate),
and is thus self-documenting.
