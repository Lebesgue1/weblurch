# Load/Save Plugin for [TinyMCE](http://www.tinymce.com)

This plugin will leverage [jsfs](https://github.com/nathancarter/jsfs) to
add load and save functionality to a TinyMCE instance.  It assumes that both
TinyMCE and jsfs have been loaded into the global namespace, so that it can
access both.

# `LoadSave` class

We begin by defining a class that will contain all the information needed regarding loading and saving a document.  An instance of this class will be stored as a member in the TinyMCE editor object.

    class LoadSave

## Class variables

As a class variable, we store the name of the app.  We allow changing this
by a global function defined at the end of this file.  Be default, there is
no app name.  If one is provided, it will be used when filling in the title
of the page, upon changes to the filename and/or document dirty state.

        appName: null

It comes with a setter, so that if the app name changes, all instances will
automatically change their app names as well.

        @setAppName: ( newname = null ) ->
            LoadSave::appName = newname
            instance.setAppName newname for instance in LoadSave::instances

We must therefore track all instances in a class variable.

        instances: [ ]

## Constructor

A newly-constructed document defaults to being clean, having no filename,
and using the app name as the filesystem name.  These attributes can be
changed with the setters defined in the following section.

        constructor: ( @editor ) ->
            @setAppName LoadSave::appName
            @setFileSystem @appName
            @setFilepath FileSystem::pathSeparator # root
            setTimeout ( => @clear() ), 0

Whenever the contents of the document changes, we mark the document dirty in
this object, which therefore adds the \* marker to the page title.

            @editor.on 'change', ( event ) => @setDocumentDirty yes

Now install into the editor controls that run methods in this object.  The
`control` method does something seemingly inefficient to duplicate the input
data object to pass to `addButton`, but this turns out to be necessary, or
the menu items look like buttons.  (I believe TinyMCE manipulates the object
upon receipt.)

            control = ( name, data ) =>
                @editor.addButton name,
                    text : data.text
                    icon : data.icon
                    shortcut : data.shortcut
                    onclick : data.onclick
                @editor.addMenuItem name, data
            control 'newfile',
                text : 'New'
                icon : 'newdocument'
                context : 'file'
                shortcut : 'ctrl+N'
                onclick : => @tryToClear()
            control 'savefile',
                text : 'Save'
                icon : 'save'
                context : 'file'
                shortcut : 'ctrl+S'
                onclick : => @tryToSave()
            @editor.addMenuItem 'saveas',
                text : 'Save as...'
                context : 'file'
                shortcut : 'ctrl+shift+S'
                onclick : => @tryToSave null, ''

Lastly, keep track of this instance in the class member for that purpose.

            LoadSave::instances.push this

## Setters

We then provide setters for the `@documentDirty`, `@filename`, and
`@appName` members, because changes to those members trigger the
recomputation of the page title.  The page title will be of the form "app
name: document title \*", where the \* is only present if the document is
dirty, and the app name (with colon) are omitted if none has been specified
in code.

        recomputePageTitle: ->
            document.title = "#{if @appName then @appName+': ' else ''}
                              #{@filename or '(untitled)'}
                              #{if @documentDirty then '*' else ''}"
        setDocumentDirty: ( setting = yes ) ->
            @documentDirty = setting
            @recomputePageTitle()
        setFilename: ( newname = null ) ->
            @filename = newname
            @recomputePageTitle()
        setFilepath: ( newpath = null ) -> @filepath = newpath
        setAppName: ( newname = null ) ->
            mustAlsoUpdateFileSystem = @appName is @fileSystem
            @appName = newname
            if mustAlsoUpdateFileSystem then @fileSystem = @appName
            @recomputePageTitle()
        setFileSystem: ( newname = @appName ) -> @fileSystem = newname

## New documents

To clear the contents of the document, use this method in its `LoadSave`
member.  It handles notifying this instance that the document is then clean.
It does *not* check to see if the document needs to be saved first; it just
outright clears the editor.  It also clears the filename, so that if you
create a new document and then save, it does not save over your last
document.

        clear: ->
            @editor.setContent ''
            @setDocumentDirty no
            @setFilename null

Unlike the previous, this function *does* first check to see if the contents
of the editor need to be saved.  If they do, and they aren't saved (or if
the user cancels), then the clear is aborted.  Otherwise, clear is run.

        tryToClear: ->
            if not @documentDirty
                @clear()
                @editor.focus()
                return
            @editor.windowManager.open {
                title : 'Save first?'
                buttons : [
                    text : 'Save'
                    onclick : =>
                        @tryToSave ( success ) => if success then @clear()
                        @editor.windowManager.close()
                ,
                    text : 'Discard'
                    onclick : =>
                        @clear()
                        @editor.windowManager.close()
                ,
                    text : 'Cancel'
                    onclick : => @editor.windowManager.close()
                ]
            }

## Saving documents

To save the current document under the filename in the `@filename` member,
call the following function.  It returns a boolean indicating success or
failure.  If there is no filename in the `@filename` member, failure is
returned and no action taken.  If the save succeeds, mark the document
clean.

        save: ->
            if @filename is null then return
            tmp = new FileSystem @fileSystem
            tmp.cd @filepath
            if tmp.write @filename, @editor.getContent(), yes # compressed
                @setDocumentDirty no

This function tries to save the current document.  When the save has been
completed or canceled, the callback will be called, with one of the
following parameters:  `false` means the save was canceled, `true` means it
succeeded, and any string means there was an error.  If the save succeeded,
the internal `@filename` field of this object may have been updated.

To force a save into a file other than the current `@filename`, pass the
other filename as the optional second parameter.  To force "save as"
behavior when there is a current `@filename`, pass null as the optional
second parameter.

        tryToSave: ( callback, filename = @filename ) ->

If there is a filename for the current document already in this object's
`@filename` member, then a save is done directly to that filename.  If there
is no filename, then a save dialog is shown.

            if filename
                @setFilename filename
                result = @save() # save happens even if no callback
                return callback? result

There is not a readily available filename, so we must pop up a "Save as"
dialog.  First we create a routine for updating the dialog we're about to
show with an enabled/disabled Save button, based on whether there is a file
selected.

            refreshDialog = ->
                dialog = document.getElementsByClassName( 'mce-window' )[0]
                for button in dialog.getElementsByTagName 'button'
                    if button.textContent is 'Save'
                        if filename
                            button.removeAttribute 'disabled'
                            button.parentNode.style.backgroundImage = null
                            button.parentNode.style.backgroundColor = null
                        else
                            button.setAttribute 'disabled', yes
                            button.parentNode.style.backgroundImage = 'none'
                            button.parentNode.style.backgroundColor = '#ccc'
                        break

Now we install a handler for when a file is selected, save that filename for
possible later use, and refresh the dialog.

            filename = null
            @saveFileNameChangedHandler = ( newname ) ->
                filename = newname
                refreshDialog()

Do the same thing for when the folder changes, but there's no need to
refresh the dialog in this case.

            filepath = null
            @changedFolderHandler = ( newfolder ) -> filepath = newfolder

Now we are sufficiently ready to pop up the dialog.  We use one made from
[filedialog.html](filedialog.html), which was copied from [the jsfs
submodule](../jsfs/demo) and modified to suit the needs of this application.

            @editor.windowManager.open {
                title : 'Save file...'
                url : 'filedialog.html'
                width : 600
                height : 400
                buttons : [
                    text : 'Save'
                    subtype : 'primary'
                    onclick : =>
                        @setFilepath filepath
                        @setFilename filename
                        @editor.windowManager.close()
                        result = @save() # save happens even if no callback
                        callback? result
                ,
                    text : 'Cancel'
                    onclick : =>
                        @editor.windowManager.close()
                        callback? no
                ]
            }, {
                fsName : @fileSystem
                mode : 'save file'
            }

# Global stuff

## Installing the plugin

The plugin, when initialized on an editor, places an instance of the
`LoadSave` class inside the editor, and points the class at that editor.

    tinymce.PluginManager.add 'loadsave', ( editor, url ) ->
        editor.LoadSave = new LoadSave editor

## Event handler

When a file dialog sends a message to the page, we look through the existing
instances of the `LoadSave` class for whichever one wants to handle that
message.  Whichever one has a handler ready, we call that handler.

    window.onmessage = ( event ) ->
        handlerName = "#{event.data[0]}Handler"
        for instance in LoadSave::instances
            if instance.hasOwnProperty handlerName
                return instance[handlerName].apply null, event.data[1..]

## Global functions

Finally, the global function that changes the app name.

    window.setAppName = ( newname = null ) -> LoadSave::appName = newname
