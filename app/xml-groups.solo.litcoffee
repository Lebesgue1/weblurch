# XML Groups Module

This module lets the client convert the contents of a TinyMCE editor (with
[the Groups plugin](../app/groupsplugin.litcoffee) enabled) into XML, and to
check first whether the structure of the groups in the document satisfies
certain criteria (so that the resulting XML will be valid).

At present, this file is still a stub; implementation coming soon.
