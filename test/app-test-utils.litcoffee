# App-Testing Utilities

When testing the main webLurch app, there are several utilities that it's
handy to have available, including functions for sending UI events to the
headless browser used for testing, as well as functions for comparing DOM
trees and injecting code into the JavaScript environment of the headless
browser.  This module provides those utilities.
